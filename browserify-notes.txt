1) cp ahoy-world.jarr into browserify/

Get all the dependencies into one file

browserify browserify/browserify-require-combined.js > browserify/nodemods.js

Copy it into the pyret code with:
cat browserify/header.js browserify/nodemods.js browserify/ahoy-world.jarr > browserify/compiled.js

Test it:

node browserify/compiled.js

Move it somewhere and run it in a webpage like web.html


To get test suite to work I had to remove "requirejs" from the list of dependencies in a define() call
Also have to remove it from nativerequires in make-standalone
also remove all debugger; statements
