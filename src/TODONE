[x] Where do built-in number methods go?
    -meta-number

[x] Think about self-reference/method invocation
  - Colon syntax for self-passing

[x] conditionals
[x] We need if

[x] Brackets for expr-based lookup
[x] See what we can share from p-base
    - A fair amount; updated definitions of get-dict, get-seal, etc.

[x] make the empty file be a valid program
[x] hook up to top level better, and drracket's repl
[x] make the definitions show up in the repl window

[x] resolve submoduley things with tokens and dedent errors
   - just have a pyret-tokenizer.rkt

[x] seal(obj, fields)
   - all of names must exist on obj
   - result is an obj with the fields as its seal, which is a mutable proxy 
     to the original obj

[X] brander()
   - produces brander object with brand() and check() methods
   - brand() used on any value, produces a copy of the value (either reference
     or prim) where this-gensym has been added to the set of brands.
   - check() recognizes any object with this-gensym in its set of brands
     and returns true, false if it does not have the brand.

[x] make a real AST (in pyret.rkt?  before or after it?)

[x] keep seal() consistent with initialization/new object fields?
    - seal doesn't care about new object fields

[x] make seal into a built-in method?
  - no, too easy to forge.  should be built-in (Discussion Nov 26)

Seal/lookup tests
  [x] no seal success
  [x] no seal field not found
  [x] 2 seals success
  [x] 2 seals caught by first
  [x] 2 seals caught by second

Assignment tests
  [x] assignment success
  [x] assignment fail
  [x] assignment seal fail
  [x] assignment seal success
  [x] 2 seals success
  [x] 2 seals caught by first
  [x] 2 seals caught by second

[x] add default initiliazers for all values in pyret.rkt e.g. (mknum 5)
