[] seal(obj, fields)
   - all of names must exist on obj
   - result is a seal(obj, fields), which is a mutable proxy to obj

[] make-brand()
   - produces brander and checker
   - brander used on any value, produces a brand(this-gensym, value) where
     value is a copy (of a reference to an object, or a prim)
   - checker recognizes any nested brand|seal(... brand(this-gensym, value))
     and returns true, false if it hits a non-brand value

[] consistent naming in grammar for lists of things
[] bug report on module docs

[] make a real AST (in pyret.rkt?  before or after it?)

[] figure out what define-syntax is less boilerplate

[] keep seal() consistent with initialization/new object fields?

[] make helper for id-parsing and str-parsing in pyret.rkt

[] ordering of things in grammar vs pyret.rkt

[] decide on a line length and enforce

[] make seal into a built-in method


[x] no seal success
[x] no seal fnf
[x] 2 seals success
[x] 2 seals caught by first
[x] 2 seals caught by second

[] assignment success
[] assignment fail
[] 

[] add default initiliazers for all values in pyret.rkt e.g. (mknum 5)
[] applicaiton should check type better
