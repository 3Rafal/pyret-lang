[] seal(obj, fields)
   - all of names must exist on obj
   - result is a seal(obj, fields), which is a mutable proxy to obj

[] make-brand()
   - produces brander and checker
   - brander used on any value, produces a brand(this-gensym, value) where
     value is a copy (of a reference to an object, or a prim)
   - checker recognizes any nested brand|seal(... brand(this-gensym, value))
     and returns true, false if it hits a non-brand value

[] consistent naming in grammar for lists of things
[] bug report on module docs

[] make a real AST (in pyret.rkt?  before or after it?)

[] figure out what define-syntax is less boilerplate

[] keep seal() consistent with initialization/new object fields?
