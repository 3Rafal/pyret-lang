Type Checker README
===================

To build:

  $ make install && make

The type checker is part of the compilation process, so to type check a file,
you can run:

  $ node build/phase1/main-wrapper.js --compile-module-js path/to/file.arr -library

Note that the -library flag is necessary for now, to avoid introducing code
into the program that the type checker cannot yet handle.
